# CoreContext

**The open delivery OS for AI workflows.** CoreContext turns a messy business process into a measurable AI operating system — context as code, skills as plugins, review surfaces built in.

---

## Vision

Every serious AI engagement produces the same five artifacts (workflow blueprint, context map, economics baseline, live review surface, launch scorecard). Today those artifacts live in slide decks, Notion pages, and bespoke code. CoreContext is the runtime where they live natively — so every engagement ships the same deliverables, every client gets a reviewable audit trail, and every workflow improvement compounds across the install base.

Three bets:

1. **Context belongs in git, not a database.** Business objects, prompts, workflow blueprints, retrieval tuning — all versioned markdown/YAML. The DB holds runtime state (skill runs, drafts, approvals) only.
2. **Skills and sources are plugins.** A published SDK with typed contracts means a partner can ship a HubSpot connector or a proposal skill without touching core.
3. **Open core beats closed product.** MetaCTO's moat is the operating model and the install base, not the code. OSS core accelerates adoption; managed cloud + implementation is the revenue engine.

---

## Product Strategy

**Position:** the delivery OS for AI workflows. Same category shape as Dagster (data orchestration), Temporal (durable workflows), Langfuse (LLM ops) — OSS runtime, commercial cloud, services on top.

**Buyer experience:** one validated workflow, one review surface, a clear expansion path. Platform handles the plumbing (context, retrieval, skills, review UI, evals, observability, reporting) so every engagement can spend its weeks on workflow design and change management, not infrastructure.

**Moats:**

- Methodology encoded in the platform (5 artifacts = platform primitives)
- Plugin ecosystem (network effect on connectors + skills)
- Monthly review becomes a generated report, not billable hours
- Client context repo = portable deliverable the client actually owns

**Economic model:**

| Tier | What | Pricing |
|---|---|---|
| OSS | Core runtime + core plugins | Free (Apache 2.0) |
| Cloud | Hosted CoreContext, managed Postgres/pgvector, evals-as-a-service, auto-scale | $/workflow-run + $/seat |
| Implementation | MetaCTO engagements (Sprint → Continuous Ops) | $45K sprints → $15K/mo retainer |
| Private plugins | Client-specific connectors, proprietary skills | Engagement or license |

### Four tiers of code and data

| Tier | Location | Content | Versioning |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Core** | `corecontext/core` (OSS) | Agent orchestrator, skill runtime, review UI, plugin SDK, retrieval pipeline, business-object model, skill_run persistence, auth, multi-tenant | semver |
| **Core plugins** | `@corecontext/plugin-*` (OSS) | Zoom, Slack, HubSpot, Apollo, Gmail, Drive, proposal-to-Gamma, research, summarize | independent semver |
| **Client plugins** | `@clientname/plugin-*` (private) | Proprietary connectors, custom skills, client-specific UI overrides | semver |
| **Client context** | `client-*-context` git repo | Business objects, domains, prompts, workflow blueprints, retrieval config, eval fixtures, economics baseline, plugin enablement | git SHA |
| **Runtime state** | Platform Postgres | skill_run history, drafts, approvals, user activity, feedback | append-only, immutable |

**Rule:** if a second client would use it, it's core. If the client owns it, it's context. If it's proprietary IP, it's a private plugin. Runtime state is never in git.

---

## Plugin Model

A plugin is an npm package that exports a manifest. Core loads manifests at boot and registers skills and sources via a typed contract. Plugins run sandboxed with a scoped context (tenant, secrets, retrieval client, db client).

### Skill contract

```ts
export const proposalSkill: Skill = {
  id: 'proposal.generate',
  version: '1.0.0',
  input: z.object({ objectId: z.string(), style: z.enum(['standard', 'deep']) }),
  output: z.object({ draftId: z.string(), gammaUrl: z.string().optional() }),
  async run(ctx, input) { /* ... */ },
  review: ProposalReviewCard, // React component for human-in-loop
  evals: [/* fixtures + expected outputs */],
};
```

### Source contract

```ts
export const hubspotSource: Source = {
  id: 'hubspot',
  version: '1.0.0',
  auth: { type: 'oauth2', scopes: ['contacts.read', 'deals.read'] },
  async fetch(ctx, cursor) { /* ... */ },
  transform(raw) { /* → documents + business_objects */ },
  retrieval: { /* defaults, overridable by client context */ },
};
```

### Plugin enablement (client context)

```yaml
# client-context/plugins.yaml
sources:
  - id: hubspot
    version: ^1.0.0
    config:
      portal_id: ${secrets.hubspot_portal_id}
  - id: zoom
    version: ^1.0.0

skills:
  - id: proposal.generate
    version: ^1.0.0
    input_defaults:
      style: deep
```

## Retrieval as Config (replaces Onyx)

**Today:** Onyx — 12-container stack (Vespa, OpenSearch, Redis, multiple Postgres, embedding models, indexing workers). Heavy, opaque, AGPL-adjacent, hard to tune per client.

**Target:** Postgres-native retrieval with a config-driven pipeline. Everything MIT / Apache / PostgreSQL-licensed. Drops from 12 containers to **zero new infra** (reuses the Postgres we already run).

### Stack

| Concern | Component | License |
|---|---|---|
| Vector store | `pgvector` | PostgreSQL |
| Keyword search | Postgres FTS (`tsvector` + GIN) | PostgreSQL |
| Hybrid ranking | Reciprocal rank fusion (SQL) | — |
| Embedding | Pluggable (OpenAI, Voyage, Cohere, Ollama, vLLM) | API / Apache |
| Reranker | Pluggable (Voyage, Cohere, bge local) | API / Apache |
| Chunking | `@corecontext/chunker` (recursive, semantic, fixed) | Apache 2.0 |
| Ingestion | Plugin sources → normalized `Document` shape | Apache 2.0 |

### Config (client context)

```yaml
# client-context/retrieval.yaml
embedder:
  provider: openai
  model: text-embedding-3-large
  dimensions: 3072
  batch_size: 96

chunking:
  strategy: recursive
  size: 1200
  overlap: 200
  respect_boundaries: [heading, paragraph]

vector:
  store: pgvector
  index: hnsw
  m: 16
  ef_construction: 64
  ef_search: 80

keyword:
  store: postgres_fts
  language: english
  boost_fields: {title: 2.0, body: 1.0}

hybrid:
  method: rrf
  k_constant: 60
  vector_weight: 1.0
  keyword_weight: 0.6

rerank:
  enabled: true
  provider: voyage
  model: rerank-2
  top_n_input: 40
  top_n_output: 8

query:
  k_nearest: 8
  similarity_threshold: 0.3
  max_context_tokens: 8000

# Per-source overrides
overrides:
  sources:
    zoom:
      chunking: {size: 2000, overlap: 300} # longer transcripts
      rerank: {top_n_output: 4}
  domains:
    sales:
      embedder: {model: text-embedding-3-small} # cost optimization
```

Every skill_run persists the retrieval config SHA and hit set, so "why did the agent retrieve X on March 3rd" is answerable six months later.

---

## Observability, Reporting, Measurement

All three feed from one event stream.

- **Events:** skills and sources emit typed spans + domain events (`skill.started`, `retrieval.completed`, `draft.approved`, `draft.rejected`, etc.)
- **Transport:** OpenTelemetry → your backend of choice (Langfuse, Honeycomb, Datadog, or Postgres tables for OSS default)
- **Economics instrumentation:** every skill_run records `baseline_cost_usd`, `assisted_time_seconds`, `approval_outcome` — makes the monthly Launch Scorecard a SQL query, not a deck-building exercise
- **Git SHA linkage:** every skill_run stores `context_sha` + plugin versions — full audit trail
- **Auto-generated deliverables:** Context Map PDF, Workflow Blueprint, Launch Scorecard all generate from `client-context/` + runtime tables. The 5 standard artifacts are byproducts, not billable hours.

---

## Roadmap

Phased to preserve MetaCTO revenue at every step; nothing ships that breaks live client work.

### Phase 1 — Context-as-Code ✓ (Q2 2026)

Pull hardcoded client data out of the app into `context/<org>/` — YAML + markdown, git-versioned.

- [x] `context/<org>/` scaffold + schema
- [x] Apply/reconcile job: repo → DB, idempotent
- [x] `context_version` table + `skill_run.context_sha` audit trail
- [x] First reference tenant extracted (MetaCTO Ziggy — see `requirements/metacto/`); legacy seed scripts retired
- [x] Authoring guide (`context/README.md`)

**Exit criteria met:** the reference tenant runs entirely from git-backed context. No client-specific strings in core.

### Phase 2 — Universal Interface Layer (Q3 2026) — partial ✓

Make CoreContext accessible from wherever you already work. Skills, context, and review queues are shared across channels.

- [x] **MCP server (stdio)** — Claude Code, Claude app, Cursor, Zed, Continue (shipped 2026-04-14)
- [x] **Auto-apply + versioning** — MCP writes to `context/<org>/`, auto-commits, applies; every write creates a `context_version` row
- [x] **Approve/reject surface** — `runtime_approve_draft` / `reject_draft` as MCP tools, plus web UI at `/dashboard/review`
- [ ] **MCP HTTP + OAuth transport** — needed for cloud / multi-tenant
- [ ] **ChatGPT Actions + listed GPT** — OAuth, OpenAPI spec auto-generated from oRPC
- [ ] **Slack bot** — slash commands, DMs, interactive approval messages
- [ ] **Teams bot** — Bot Framework adapter

**Exit criteria:** Chris can build + modify Ziggy from Claude Code via MCP (done ✓). A skill run started in Slack shows up in the same review queue as one started in the web UI (pending Slack adapter).

### Phase 3 — Plugin SDK v1 (Q4 2026)

Extract skills and sources from the monorepo into a publishable plugin contract. Prerequisite for ecosystem + for a meta-agent that composes them.

- [x] v0.1 — Skill contract, registry, loader, dual-path execution, sample plugin (shipped 2026-04-14)
- [ ] v0.2 — Extract to `@corecontext/sdk` npm package
- [ ] Source contract for connectors (Teams, HubSpot, DocuSign, Gamma as first plugins)
- [ ] Pluggable LLM provider on plugin skills (`openai | anthropic | vertex | azure-openai`)
- [ ] Review UI components shipped via plugins
- [ ] Plugin hot-reload in dev, semver resolution in prod
- [ ] Eval harness runs plugin evals on CI for every PR

**Exit criteria:** a partner can publish a skill or source without a core PR.

### Phase 4 — Feedback + Self-Improvement Loop (Q1 2027)

Make every skill and workflow learnable. Platform-wide, not per-agent — applies equally to Ziggy's email drafts, the NINJIO account manager's prep packs, any future skill. Closes the loop on human review so prompts improve without becoming opaque.

- [ ] `skill_run.feedback` column: rating (thumb up/down), note, submitted_by, submitted_at
- [ ] UI hooks in review queue + post-hoc feedback surface (email "was this useful?" link)
- [ ] `workflow_run.feedback` equivalent
- [ ] `improve_skill` meta-skill: aggregates last N runs + feedback, proposes prompt diff as a PR-style context change (branch, not main)
- [ ] Eval harness runs proposed prompt vs current on held-out fixtures before merge
- [ ] Weekly `skill_improvement_review` workflow — scheduled, surfaces candidates for human review

**Exit criteria:** a skill that underperforms shows up on a weekly report with auto-drafted prompt improvements ready for human approval.

### Phase 5 — Native Retrieval (Q2 2027)

Replace Onyx with the pgvector-native pipeline. Also introduce `backend:` in `retrieval.yaml` so enterprise customers can point at Vertex AI Search or Azure AI Search instead of native — without changing the platform abstractions.

- [ ] pgvector schema + HNSW index (native default)
- [ ] Postgres FTS layer
- [ ] RRF hybrid ranker
- [ ] Pluggable embedder + reranker interfaces + default implementations
- [ ] `retrieval.yaml` config: `backend: native | vertex-search | azure-search`
- [ ] Vertex + Azure backends as source plugins (opt-in, enterprise)
- [ ] Migration tool: existing Onyx index → pgvector
- [ ] Deprecate Onyx containers

**Exit criteria:** zero Onyx dependency in new deployments; feature parity on search quality. Enterprise customers can pick managed backend at deploy.

### Phase 6 — Auto-Generated Deliverables (Q3 2027)

Turn the 5 standard artifacts into platform output.

- [ ] Workflow Blueprint generator (renders from `workflows/*.md`)
- [ ] Context Map PDF export
- [ ] Economics Baseline dashboard from skill_run aggregates
- [ ] Launch Scorecard (monthly) — SQL + templated deck, exports to Gamma
- [ ] Monthly Review runner (computes the 6-section agenda automatically)

**Exit criteria:** a MetaCTO ops lead generates the monthly review deck with one click.

### Phase 7 — Conversational Bootstrap / WOW (Q4 2027)

The magic moment. User connects sources, describes a workflow in natural language, and CoreContext builds it — skill YAML, prompt MD, workflow YAML, all PR-reviewable. Sits after Plugin SDK + Native Retrieval + Feedback Loop so the meta-agent has a clean, composable, self-correcting substrate underneath.

- [x] **Workflow primitive** — trigger → steps → action, composes skills/objects (shipped 2026-04-14 — pulled forward)
- [ ] **Meta-agent** — a special skill with write access to `context/<org>/`; takes NL intent, emits manifests, uses all the MCP write tools
- [ ] **Event bus wiring** — workflow triggers: event, schedule, webhook (schema exists; bus doesn't)
- [ ] **Self-service OAuth** — users connect Gmail/HubSpot/DocuSign themselves (no admin config)
- [ ] **Onboarding stepper** — connect → ingest → chat → build, with live progress
- [ ] **Sample workflow library** — import templates (Ziggy-style skills as starting points)
- [ ] **Preview-on-real-data** — "I just built this. Here's what it would do on your last 5 discovery calls. Keep?"

**Exit criteria:** a prospect goes from cold to running their first AI workflow in under 10 minutes.

### Phase 8 — OSS Launch + MetaCTO Cloud (Q1 2028)

- [ ] Public repo + Apache 2.0 license
- [ ] Docs site, getting-started, contributor guide
- [ ] MetaCTO Cloud beta: hosted Postgres + pgvector, managed evals, SSO
- [ ] Reference installs: 3 external clients running OSS in production
- [ ] Launch blog + conference talk

**Exit criteria:** OSS stars trending; first non-MetaCTO contributor PR merged; first paid cloud customer.

### Phase 9 — Ecosystem + Enterprise (Q2 2028+)

- [ ] Plugin marketplace (listings, signing, permission scopes)
- [ ] SSO/SAML, SCIM, audit export, data residency regions
- [ ] Document-level RBAC at retrieval + agent layers
- [ ] Role-based skill access + multi-step approval chains
- [ ] Community plugin incentives (bounties for top connectors)

## Licensing

**Open core. Permissive.** The runtime is free; cloud operation and bespoke IP are commercial.

| Artifact | License | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| CoreContext core (runtime, SDK, review UI) | **Apache 2.0** | Patent grant matters for enterprise adoption; wide community adoption (Dagster, Langchain, Hugging Face precedent) |
| Core plugins (Zoom, HubSpot, proposal, etc.) | **Apache 2.0** | Same rationale; encourages forks and customization |
| MetaCTO Cloud control plane | **BSL 1.1 → Apache 2.0 after 4 years** | Prevents hyperscaler from hosting competitive SaaS while the market forms; auto-converts to Apache for long-term trust |
| Client plugins (proprietary connectors, custom skills) | **Commercial** (per-engagement or license) | Client or MetaCTO IP |
| Client context repos | **Owned by client** | Portable deliverable; MetaCTO has write access under engagement |
| MetaCTO methodology docs (ECE Wiki, playbooks) | **CC BY-NC 4.0** or proprietary | Brand/IP protection without preventing public reference |

**Trademark:** "CoreContext" and MetaCTO logos held by MetaCTO, Inc. Forks must rebrand.

## What We Use Today That Gets Replaced

| Today | Problem | Replacement | When |
|---|---|---|---|
| Onyx (AGPL-ish, 12 containers, opaque tuning) | Heavy, license-adjacent, hard to customize per client | pgvector + Postgres FTS + RRF + pluggable embed/rerank; Vertex/Azure backends opt-in | Phase 5 |
| Hardcoded prompts in TS files | Not reviewable, no version history, client-specific strings in core | `context/<org>/prompts/*.md` with git history | Phase 1 ✓ |
| Business objects seeded via migration scripts | Opaque, coupled to schema changes, no per-client variance | `context/<org>/objects/*.yaml` applied at boot | Phase 1 ✓ |
| Skills as imports in app code | Can't be shipped by third parties, hot-reload impossible | Plugin SDK with manifest + sandbox | Phase 3 (v0.1 ✓) |
| Langfuse (external SaaS) as only observability | Lock-in; not OSS-compatible by default | OpenTelemetry → pluggable backend (Langfuse/Honeycomb/Postgres) | Phase 5 |
| Temporal (heavy for our scale) | Over-provisioned for current workflow complexity | In-process durable step runner on Postgres (shipped, v1); Temporal adapter for scale-out | Phase 7 |
| Static prompts, no learning | Drafts get approved/rejected with zero feedback loop; prompts drift out of date | `skill_run.feedback` + `improve_skill` meta-skill proposing PR-style prompt diffs | Phase 4 |

---

## Getting Started

```bash
npm install
cp .env.example .env.local       # Fill in API keys
docker compose up -d postgres    # Postgres 16 + pgvector
npm run db:migrate
npm run context:apply            # sync context/<org>/ → DB (agents, skills, object types)
npm run dev:next                 # http://localhost:3000
```

### Edit client context

All prompts, skills, agents, and object types live in `context/<org>/` as YAML + markdown. Edit a file, then run `npm run context:apply` to sync. See [`context/README.md`](./context/README.md) for the authoring guide.

```bash
npm run context:check            # validate + diff (no writes)
npm run context:apply            # sync to DB, records context_version audit row
npm run context:export           # (bootstrap) dump current DB rows to context/<org>/
```

### Run evals

```bash
npx tsx src/scripts/run-evals.ts
```

## Case Study: Ziggy (Sales Ops Agent)

Ziggy is the first packaged agent on CoreContext, dogfooding MetaCTO's own sales operations. As of Phase 1, Ziggy's prompts, skills, and object types all live in `context/metacto/` — git-tracked, reviewable, and detached from app code.

**What Ziggy does:**
- Finds and classifies discovery calls from Zoom transcripts
- Generates structured summaries with prospect, budget, timeline, next steps
- Drafts capabilities follow-up emails and proposal decks (Gamma)
- Searches across HubSpot, Gmail, Zoom, Google Drive
